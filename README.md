## Introduction
This project was part of a data challenge to classify medical records into multiple ICD10 codes. The dataset consisted of 200,000 samples for training, with embeddings as features and a multi-hot target label vector.

**Key Objectives:**
- Predict multiple ICD10 codes accurately for unseen records.
- Optimize for average micro-F2 evaluation metric.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for multi-label datasets.
- Model training using state-of-the-art techniques:
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks (TensorFlow).
- Efficient batch-wise evaluation for large datasets.
- Ensemble methods for better prediction reliability.
